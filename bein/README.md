bein 1.1.0
Copyright 2011 EPFL BBCF <webmaster dot bbcf at epfl dot ch>

Bein is a workflow manager and miniature LIMS system built in the
Bionformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility of the EPFL.  It fills
the gap for the working scientist between the classical shell and big
workflow managers like KNIME or Galaxy and major LIMS systems like
OpenBIS.
