:mod:`bein` -- LIMS and workflow manager for bioinformatics
===========================================================

.. module:: bein
   :platform: Unix
   :synopsis: Workflow and provenance manager for bioinformatics
.. moduleauthor:: BBCF <webmaster.bbcf@epfl.ch>

Bein contains a miniature LIMS (Laboratory Information Management
System) and a workflow manager.  It was written for the Bioinformatics
and Biostatistics Core Facility of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de
Lausanne.  It is aimed at processes just complicated enough where the
Unix shell becomes problematic, but not so large as to justify all the
machinery of big workflow managers like KNIME or Galaxy.

This module contains all the core logic and functionality of bein.

There are three core classes you need to understand:

execution
    The actual class is Execution, but it is generally created with the
    execution contextmanager.  An execution tracks all the information
    about a run of a given set of programs.  It corresponds roughly to a
    script in shell.

MiniLIMS
    MiniLIMS represents a database and a directory of files.  The database
    stores metainformation about the files and records all executions run
    with this MiniLIMS.  You can go back and examine the return code, stdout,
    stderr, imported files, etc. from any execution.

program
    The @program decorator provides a very simple way to bind external
    programs into bein for use in executions.

            touch('boris')

    It creates a temporary directory where the execution will work,
    sets up the ``Execution`` object, then runs the body of the
    ``with`` statement.  After the body finished, or if it fails and
    throws an exception, ``execution`` writes the ``Execution`` to the
    MiniLIMS repository and deletes the temporary directory after all
    is finished.

    The ``Execution`` has field ``id`` set to ``None`` during the
    ``with`` block, but afterwards ``id`` is set to the execution ID
    it ran as.  For example::

        with execution(mylims) as ex:

    /nfs/boris/scratch/abc.  In this case, running programs via LSF
    would not work correctly.

    If this is the case, you can pass the equivalent directory on
    worker nodes as *remote_working_directory*.  In the example above,
    an execution may create a directory lK4321fdr21 in /scratch/abc.
    On the worker node, it would be /nfs/boris/scratch/abc/lK4321fd21,

class program(object):
    """Decorator to wrap external programs for use by bein.

    Bein depends on external programs to do most of its work.  In this
    sense, it's a strange version of a shell.  The ``@program`` decorator
    makes bindings to external programs only a couple lines long.

    To wrap a program, write a function that takes whatever arguments
    you will need to vary in calling the program (for instance, the
    filename for touch or the number of seconds to sleep for sleep).
    This function should return a dictionary containing two keys,
    ``'arguments'`` and ``'return_value'``.  ``'arguments'`` should
    point to a list of strings which is the actual command and
    arguments to be executed (``["touch",filename]`` for touch, for instance).
    ``'return_value'`` should point to a value to return, or a callable
    object which takes a ProgramOutput object and returns the value
    that will be passed back to the user when this program is run.

    For example, to wrap touch, we write a one argument function that
    takes the filename of the file to touch, and apply the ``@program``
    decorator to it::

        @program
        def touch(filename):
            return {"arguments": ["touch",filename],
                    "return_value": filename}

    Once we have such a function, how do we call it?  We can call it
    directly, but ``@program`` inserts an additional argument at the
    beginning of the argument list to take the execution the program
    is run in.  Typically it will be run like::

        with execution(lims) as ex:
            touch(ex, "myfile")

    where ``lims`` is a MiniLIMs object.  The ProgramOutput of touch
    is automatically recorded to the execution ``ex`` and stored in the
    MiniLIMS.  The value returned by touch is ``"myfile"``, the name of
    the touched file.

    Often you want to call a function, but not block when it returns
    so you can run several in parallel.  ``@program`` also creates a
    method ``nonblocking`` which does this.  The return value is a
    Future object with a single method: ``wait()``.  When you call
    ``wait()``, it blocks until the program finishes, then returns the
    same value that you would get from calling the function directly.
    So to touch two files, and not block until both commands have
    started, you would write::

        with execution(lims) as ex:
            a = touch.nonblocking(ex, "myfile1")
            b = touch.nonblocking(ex, "myfile2")
            a.wait()
            b.wait()

    By default, ``nonblocking`` runs local processes, but you can
    control how it runs its processes with the ``via`` keyword
    argument.  For example, on systems using the LSF batch submission
    systems, you can run commands via batch submission by passing the
    ``via`` argument the value ``"lsf"``::

        with execution(lims) as ex:
            a = touch.nonblocking(ex, "myfile1", via="lsf")
            a.wait()

    You can force local execution with ``via="local"``.

    Some programs do not accept an output file as an argument and only
    write to ``stdout``.  Alternately, you might need to capture
    ``stderr`` to a file.  All the methods of ``@program`` accept
    keyword arguments ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to specify files to
    write these streams to.  If they are omitted, then both streams
    are captured and returned in the ``ProgramOutput`` object.

        in a separate thread, and returns an object which lets the

        method.  When wait() is called, the thread blocks, and the

    The @task decorator wraps a function in an execution and handles
    producing a sensible return value.  The function must expect its
    first argument to be an execution.  The function produced by @task
    instead expects a MiniLIMS (or ``None``) in its place.
    You can also pass a ``description`` keyword argument, which will
    be used to set the description of the execution.  For example,::

        @task
        def f(ex, filename):
            touch(ex, filename)
            ex.add(filename, "New file")

    will be wrapped into a function that is called as::

        f(M, "boris", description="An execution")

    where ``M`` is a MiniLIMS.  It could also be called with ``None``
    in place of ``M``::

        f(None, "boris")

    which is the same as creating an execution without attaching it to
    a MiniLIMS. (In this case it will fail, since ``f`` tries to add a
    file to the MiniLIMS.)

    The return value is a dictionary with three keys:

        * ``value`` is the value returned by the function which @task
          wrapped.

        * ``files`` is a dictionary of all files the execution added
          to the MiniLIMS, with their descriptions as keys and their
          IDs in the MiniLIMS as values.

        * ``execution`` is the execution ID.

    In the call to ``f`` above, the return value would be (with some
    other value for ``'execution'`` in practice)::
