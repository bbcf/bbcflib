Copyright 2010 Frederick Ross <madhadron at gmail dot com>

bbcflib is a set of Python modules for accessing facilities used by
the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core FacilityË˜(BBCF) at the EPFL.
At the moment it provides modules for BBCF's GenRep, the LIMS of the
DNA Array Facility at UNIL, the standard frontend code for workflows
written by Fabrice David, and sending job description emails.

Installation
------------

bbcflib doesn't have regular releases, since it is an internally used
library.  You should download the latest source code from GitHub,
either by going to

    http://github.com/madhadron/bbcflib

and clicking on "Downloads", or by cloning the git repository with

$ git clone https://github.com/madhadron/bein.git

Once you have the source code, run

$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install

to install it.  If you need to install it in a particular directory,
use

$ sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/prefix/path

Then the modules will go in /prefix/path/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages,
where X.Y is the version of Python you run it with.

Known issues
------------

None.
