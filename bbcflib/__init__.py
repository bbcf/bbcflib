Description
===========

bbcflib is a set of Python modules for accessing facilities used by
the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility (BBCF) at the EPFL.
It provides modules for BBCF's

* *GenRep* (genome data repository),
* the LIMS of the DNA Array Facilities at UNIL and UNIGE,
* the standard frontend code for workflows written by Fabrice David,
* sending job completion emails.
* the *GDV* api for viewing genome tracks
* *mapseq* to map reads to reference genomes
* *chipseq* to run ChIP-seq analyses
* *rnaseq* to map reads to reference transcriptomes and compute statistics of differential expression

All the functionality can be imported with::

    import bbcflib.module

where module is one of:

* ``GenRep`` and ``Assembly`` from  :doc:`bbcflib_genrep`
* ``EmailReport`` from :doc:`bbcflib_email`
* ``DAFLIMS`` from :doc:`bbcflib_daflims`
* ``Frontend`` from :doc:`bbcflib_frontend`
* ``mapseq`` from :doc:`bbcflib_mapseq`
* ``chipseq`` from :doc:`bbcflib_chipseq`
* ``rnaseq`` from :doc:`bbcflib_rnaseq`
* ``gdv`` from :doc:`bbcflib_gdv`

============
Installation
============

bbcflib requires:

* Python >=2.6
* mailer >=0.6 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mailer)
* bein (http://bbcf.epfl.ch/bein/)
* numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* libmagic (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmagic/)

    Mac OS and Windows
    ==================

    On these system by default libmagic is not present.

    Generic procedure installation
    ------------------
        * download latest version from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/
        * extract directory from archive
        * inside directory run
          * ./configure
          * make
          * make install

    Mac OS with homebrew
    ------------------
        run command below:
            * brew install libmagic
            * chmod +x [Path to Cellar]/libmagic/[version]/bin/file
            Path to Cellar by default = /usr/local/Cellar
            At this time version = 5/04
            * brew link libmagic
        Warning: 5.04 number is libmagic version this number could change!


bbcflib doesn't have regular releases, since it is an internally used
library. You should download the latest source code from GitHub,
either by going to::

    http://github.com/bbcf/bbcflib

and clicking on "Downloads", or by cloning the git repository with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/bbcf/bbcflib.git

Once you have the source code, run::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

to install it. If you need to install it in a particular directory,
use::

    $ sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/prefix/path

Then the modules will go in /prefix/path/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages,
where X.Y is the version of Python you run it with.

To run the test suite, in the distribution directory, run::

    $ nosetests
